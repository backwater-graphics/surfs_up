# Surfs_up

## Overview of the statistical analysis

The goal of this analysis was to create a basic statistical analysis of the temperatures on Oahu during the months of June and December. This is to help determine whether or not the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. By creating a query that captures the temperatures specifically for the months of June and December, we can retrieve information such as average, maximum, and minimum temperatures.

## Results

After comparing and analyzing the results from June and December the three key differences in the weather between them is as follows:
-	The first difference we noticed was that comparing the temperatures, it apparently shows that June’s temperature indicators are higher than December.
-	The second difference we noticed that was over 7 years, there are 1574 precipitations that occurred and 1700 temperatures that was observed in June, which was higher than 1405 precipitations and 1517 temperatures observed in December. The different (1700-1517 = 183) between two observations counts that indicate the data of Dec, 2017 not included in the database.
- And the third difference we see in the results is when you look at the standard deviation for June temperatures which we notice is slightly smaller (3.26) compared to the standard deviation in the December temperature (3.75), this impacts temperature ranges and temperature fluctuation. The range of temperatures in June are smaller and therefore warmer compared to the range of temperatures in December, which are larger and therefore colder.

## Summary

In summary of the statistical analysis to help determine if the weather or not the surf and ice cream shop business will be sustainable and based on the temperature patterns over seven years, we can conclude that the weather will stay steady throughout the whole year. However, there would be two more additional queries that I would recommend to be performed to gather more weather data for June and December:
-	Average wind speeds – These measurements would help to determine the quality of surfing and how many optimal hours of operation the shop could have.
-	Sever weather/Hurricane data – This would help to know how many if any adverse weather events that produce high winds and high precipitation.
